<h2>Construction</h2>
In order to give rise to non-linearity, we must choose a suitable $g_i$. As it turns out, if we choose appropriate activation functions $g_i$ and the correct structure, we can approximate any function (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem">universal approximation theorem</a>).
