The heat equation is a well-known partial differential equation that models the diffusion of heat. It's a specific form of the diffusion equation:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2  u$$

where $u$ is the temperature function, $\nabla^2$ is the Laplace operator, and $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. More precisely, $u: (\mathbf{R}^n, \mathbf{R}) \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$, where the codomain describes the temperature and the domain is a 2-tuple describing $n$-dimensional space and time. For example, consider the 2D heat equation:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) $$

In video games--particularly simulation-type ones--this equation can be used as a basic building block toward more complex phenomena. For example, it can be combined with stochastic functions to crudely model radioactivity.

Given unforced inputs, analytically solving such an equation is generally intractable. However, approximation is straightforward: finite-difference methods work well across most problem sets, where the idea is to discretize each derivative. Since there are second-order derivatives here, the simplest would be the second-order central difference:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u(\vec{p}^{\,}, t)}{\partial {\vec{p}^{\,}_i}^2} = \frac{u(\vec{p}^{\,} + \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) + u(\vec{p}^{\,} - \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) - 2u(\vec{p}^{\,}, t)}{\delta^2} + O(\delta^2)$$

where $\vec{p}^{\,}$ is the point in $n$ dimensions, $t$ is time, $\textbf{e}_i$ is a vector with 1 at the $i$th index and 0 everywhere else, and $\delta$ is size of discretization. For example, consider the "expanded" second-order central difference to the 2D heat equation:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u(x, y, t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u(x + \Delta x, y, t) + u(x - \Delta x, y, t) - 2u(x, y, t)}{\delta^2}$$

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u(x, y, t)}{\partial y^2} \approx \frac{u(x, y + \Delta y, t) + u(x, y - \Delta y, t) - 2u(x, y, t)}{\delta^2}$$

We will now derive the central difference using Taylor series expansions:

Consider $u(\vec{p}^{\,} + \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) + u(\vec{p}^{\,} - \delta \textbf{e}_i, t)$:

$$ \begin{align} u(\vec{p}^{\,} + \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) + u(\vec{p}^{\,} - \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) &amp;= \left(u_t + \delta \frac{\partial u}{\partial \vec{p}^{\,}_i} + \frac{\delta^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial {\vec{p}^{\,}_i}^2} \right) + \left(u_t - \delta \frac{\partial u}{\partial \vec{p}^{\,}_i} + \frac{\delta^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial {\vec{p}^{\,}_i}^2} \right) + O(\delta^4) \\ &amp;= 2u(\vec{p}^{\,}, t) + \delta^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial {\vec{p}^{\,}_i}^2} + O(\delta^4)\end{align}$$

Note that the $O(\delta^3)$ term was cancelled out.

$$ \therefore \frac{\partial^2 u(\vec{p}^{\,}, t)}{\partial {\vec{p}^{\,}_i}^2} = \frac{u(\vec{p}^{\,} + \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) + u(\vec{p}^{\,} - \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) - 2u(\vec{p}^{\,}, t)}{\delta^2} + O(\delta^2)$$

With numerical approximation

$$u_{ij} = \frac{u(\vec{p}^{\,} + \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) + u(\vec{p}^{\,} - \delta \textbf{e}_i, t) - 2u(\vec{p}^{\,}, t)}{\delta^2} $$

We drop off the $O(\delta^2)$ error to obtain the numerical solution $u_{ij}$, the approximation to the second derivative at the $i$th coordinate at time $j$. Positional information has been omitted for brevity. The final solution can then be approximated using

$$ U_{j+1} = U_j + \Delta t \left(\alpha \Sigma_{i=1}^n u_{ij}\right)$$

where $U_j$ is the approximation to the temperature at time $j$ and $n$ is the number of dimensions.

An example would explain everything better. Consider again the 2D heat equation:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) $$

And its discrete counterpart

$$ \frac{\Delta u_j}{\Delta t} = \alpha \left(u_{1j} + u_{2j}\right) $$

The final solution would be

$$ U_{j+1} = U_j + \Delta t\left(\alpha \left(u_{1j} + u_{2j}\right)\right)$$

It should be noted that large values of $\alpha$ and $\Delta t$ lead to instability. Empirically, $\alpha \times \Delta t \lt 0.25$ works well.
